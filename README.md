# 🛡️ Rondel

Rondel is a library that makes use of the JavaScript Proxy API and exposes certain functionalities to control objects through the use of handlers.

Why "Rondel"?

As stated in Wikipedia: *A rondel (ˈrɒndl) is a circular piece of metal used for protection, as part of a harness of plate armour, or attached to a helmet, breastplate, couter or on a gauntlet.* It is mainly used to protect the most fragile parts of humans when using suits of armors in the middle age. So instead of humans, we're protecting `objects` in order to avoid certain bad practices.
